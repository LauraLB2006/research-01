### Spring 2016 - Data Management and Manipulation in R
This seminar will provide an introduction to basic data management and manipulation using the programming language `R`. Using `R` for data analysis is becoming increasingly common because it is free, open-source, exceptionally flexible, and highly extensible - all features that set it apart from commercial statistical software. We will cover a number of topics, including the basic syntax of `R` commands, importing data into `R`, creating and modifying numeric and string data, and reshaping datasets. All of the examples will use sample data that comes pre-loaded with distributions of `R`.


### About the SLU Data Science Seminar
