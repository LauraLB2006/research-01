# Getting Started

You need to have `R` installed and **RStudio** open.

You also need to have executed the following two functions in the console:

```r
install.packages("usethis")

usethis::use_course("https://bit.ly/2wISdxO")
```

RStudio should open a new window that says `research-01` in the upper right hand corner.
