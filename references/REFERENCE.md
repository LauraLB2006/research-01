# research-01 Reference

* CRAN - the official distribution system for `R` and `R` packages
* Function - "a sequence of program instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit" (via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine))
* Package - a collection or library of functions that are typically focused on solving a single problem; `R` packages are modular so a single package will typically build on multiple other packages' functionality
* Working directory - The root directory that is associated with a particular file or process 
    - Significance - "When the process refers to a file using a simple file name or relative path (as opposed to a file designated by a full path from a root directory), the reference is interpreted relative to the current working directory of the process." (via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory))
